### How to verify a kani harness using the extension


As soon as the rust file containing the proofs is opened using the Kani extension in a VSCode instance, you should see the Kani proofs loaded as regular unit tests in the Testing Panel on the left border of VSCode. This is how the testing page looks like when you click on the panel.

### Running Proofs


You can then run your proofs using the test tree by clicking the play button beside the harness that was automatically picked up by the Kani Extension. Once you run the proof using the extension, you are shown an error message if the proof has failed. We are then presented with two buttons, to generate the full report for the harness or to run concrete playback to generate unit tests with the counter examples loaded.

### View and Debug Proofs through the Trace

You can generate the unit test with the counter examples by clicking on the **Run Concrete Playback for (your harness name)`** Button that appears through a blue link on the error banner.

You can see that the source is annotated with two buttons that hover over the unit test generated called â†’ `Run Test (Kani) | Debug Test (Kani)` which allow you to run and debug the test just like any other rust unit test.

### Running Kani-generated test

Clicking the unit test using the `Run Test (Kani)` button, runs the unit test generated by concrete playback.

### Debug Kani unit test

By setting breakpoints and clicking the debug test (kani) button, you are taken into the debugger panel which allows you to peer into the counter examples or values for which the assert fails.

(**NOTE TO READER -** Try reloading page to view the gif).


You can then use the debugger controller to step through, into, out of, replay and also change values on the trace panel on the left for interactive debugging.

### Generate HTML report

By clicking the view report button in the error message, you can view the trace for the harness in a rendered HTML report.

### View Report in-window

You can click on the `Preview in Editor` to view the HTML trace within vscode. It should look like this -

### View Kani Log

For every test run, you can view full output from kani logged into the output channel as a text file. To view the log, open the output channel, and click on the channels drop down list to view a channel called `Output (Kani): ...`
